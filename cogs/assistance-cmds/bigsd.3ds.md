Although Nintendo says the official SD size limit is 32GB, the 3DS can accept cards up to 2TB.
In order to use them, you will have to format them to FAT32 first.
You can do this using these tools:

-GUIFormat for Windows: http://ridgecrop.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm
-gparted for Linux: https://gparted.org/download.php
-Disk Utility for macOS: https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/format-a-disk-for-windows-computers-dskutl1010

IMPORTANT: On macOS, always select "MS-DOS (Fat)". Formatting will erase all data on the card. Make a backup first.
