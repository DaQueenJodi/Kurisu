There is no complete list about what is possible and what not, but to give you an idea of what you can do, here is an overview:

-Have custom themes,
-Run emulators (up to N64 works, with a bit of modification GCN/Wii work fine as well but it varies from game to game),
-Run custom homebrew apps,
-Backup, edit and restore game saves,
-Dump game cartridges (to look at the contents, for example)
-Mod games,
-Run Android or Linux on your Switch,
-Still have access to normal stock features (e.g. eShop, online services etc.)
