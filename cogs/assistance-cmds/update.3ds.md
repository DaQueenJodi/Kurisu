**Is it safe to update to current 3DS firmware?**

**Luma3DS 10.2.1 and above**
You can update safely.

**Luma3DS 8.0 - 10.2**
Please follow the directions on the 3DS Hacks Guide [Restoring / Updating CFW](https://3ds.hacks.guide/restoring-updating-cfw) page, then you can update safely. Being on these Luma3DS versions on 11.8+ will cause an error screen until you update.

**Luma3DS 7.1**
Follow the [B9S upgrade guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/updating-b9s)

**Luma3DS 7.0.5 and below**
Follow the [a9lh-to-b9s guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/a9lh-to-b9s)

**To find out your Luma3DS version, hold select on bootup and look at the top left corner of the top screen**
