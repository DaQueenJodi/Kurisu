If for whatever reason you can no longer read the sticker, you may view it on your console digitally:

step 1: open System Settings

step 2: go to the System tab

step 3: scroll down and press on Serial information

Your serial will now be displayed on the screen.

This is where the serial is located. Use your serial along with the `.ssnc` command in <#261581918653513729> to check if you are patched.
