If for whatever reason you can no longer read the sticker, you may view it on your console digitally:

step 1: open System Settings
step 2: go to the System tab
step 3: scroll down and press on Serial information

Your serial will now be displayed on the screen.

This is where the serial is located. Use this number to check if you are patched.
