Although Nintendo supports large SD cards in EXFAT format, it is recommended to use FAT32.
In order to change the card's format, you will need to use an external utility.
Here are some suggestions:

-GUIFormat for Windows: http://ridgecrop.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm
-gparted for Linux: https://gparted.org/download.php
-Disk Utility for macOS: https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/format-a-disk-for-windows-computers-dskutl1010

IMPORTANT: On macOS, always select "MS-DOS (Fat)". Formatting will erase all data on the card. Make a backup first.
